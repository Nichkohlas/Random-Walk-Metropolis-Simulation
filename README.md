# Random Walk Metropolis Simulation

As part of my *Programming for Data Science* coursework, this project implements the **Random Walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm** in Python and R to generate random samples from a target probability density function (PDF).

---

## Project Overview
The **Random Walk Metropolis algorithm** is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method used for sampling from complex probability distributions.
In this project, I:
- Implemented the algorithm **from scratch** in both Python and R.
- Simulated **10,000 iterations** using a defined step size.
- Visualized the sampled values to confirm they reflect the target distribution.

---

## Key Features
- **Custom Implementation:** Built the RWM algorithm from scratch.
- **Cross-Language Comparison:** Implemented in **both Python and R** to validate results.
- **Convergence Visualization:** Generated overlaying plots and histograms to confirm accurate sampling.
